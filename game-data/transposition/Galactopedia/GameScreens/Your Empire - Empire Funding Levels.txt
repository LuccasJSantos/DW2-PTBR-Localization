You can adjust how your earnings are allocated in the "Bonus Funding Levels" screen. Hover over each value for more details.

[H3]Allocation of Maintenance Resources[/H3]
Embrace this screen to set percentage values for your primary recurring expense areas: Ship and Base Upkeep, Troop Upkeep, and Facility Maintenance. These percentages will restrict how much your advisors are willing to spend in each sector.

If you assign 50% of your earnings to Ship Upkeep, then your advisors will support ship construction up to a maintenance threshold of 50% of your economic output. However, they won't propose new ships once this limit is reached.

Restricting spending in each area permits a more balanced distribution of your earnings across all sectors of your economy, preventing overspending in one area.

You may also specify a percentage of your earnings that remains unspent, creating a cash reserve for future acquisitions and expenses.

[H3]Excess Income for Colony Expansion and Research[/H3]
Any surplus income can be directed towards either Colony Expansion or Research. Allocating resources to these areas will accelerate the growth rate of your colonies or enhance research speed within your empire.

If you automate Funding Levels, your economic advisors will use any excess income to maintain maximum research speed while allocating the remainder to colony expansion rates.
