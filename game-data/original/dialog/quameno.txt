TREATY_REJECT			;No, we do not want {0} right now
TREATY_REJECT_TOOSOON_NEUTRAL			;We are sorry, but {0} with you would not work right now. It is too soon after the last change to our relations

PROTECTION_REJECT_NEUTRAL		;No, protecting you would be too much work
PROTECTION_REJECT_ANGRY		;No, we do not want to protect you. We'd much rather raid you
PROTECTION_REJECT_FRIENDLY		;No, we don't want a Protection Arrangement with you

CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;This disappoints us. We felt that this treaty was most worthwhile.\n\nBut we respect your decision to end it
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;How unfortunate.\n\nBut it is good to speak openly with each other in these important matters
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_ANGRY		;Your feelings match ours - we no longer want this treaty either.\n\nIt is best for it to end
CANCELPROTECTION_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;How illogical. We thought those monthly payments worked well, at least for us
