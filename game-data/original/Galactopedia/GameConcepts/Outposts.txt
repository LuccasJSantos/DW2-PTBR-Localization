Outposts are small enclosed surface settlements that can be established at planets and moons.

They are ideal for settling planets that would otherwise be inhospitable to colonization. They are particularly useful to acquire important ruins with empire bonuses or valuable resources.

[H3]Differences from Colonies[/H3]
While Outposts are similar to Colonies in some ways, they also have a number of important differences.

The key difference is that Outposts do not grow beyond their initial settlement population.

Outposts also do not pay tax. So they have no income.

They can be established at any planet or moon with a solid surface where the suitability is -50 or better.

[H3]Support Costs[/H3]
Outposts have support costs that correlate to the suitability of the planets population. Lower suitability increases support costs, whereas better suitability lessens support costs.

Thus Outposts are always a net drain on your economy - they never earn money, but always have support costs.

So you should carefully consider whether you really want to establish an outpost at a location. There should be some clear benefit to the Outpost that outweighs the support costs.

[H3]Outposts claim territory[/H3]
Outposts also claim their entire system as territory for your empire.

However because Outposts do not grow, their territory will never project beyond their system.

[H3]Restrictions[/H3]
Outposts also have some restrictions:
[ULI]they cannot build new ships or bases[/ULI]
[ULI]they cannot build most planetary facilities[/ULI]
[ULI]they cannot recruit troops[/ULI]

There is also a limit on the total number of Outposts: you can only have one Outpost for each Colony in your empire.

[H3]Establishing new Outposts[/H3]
Establishing an Outpost requires sending a Colony Ship to the target planet, but instead of performing a 'Colonization' mission, the ship performs an 'Establish Outpost' mission.

The New Colonies List can also be used to queue up new Outposts, just the same as you do for Colonization.

In addition you can also use the 'Queue Outpost' action button under the Selection Panel for any uninhabited planet or moon that qualifies as an outpost.
