    <Title>Glory Awaits!</Title>
    <Text>In the Ancient Mortalen Troopship Ruins we have made a curious discovery:

We are the Slayers of the Mortak, the Bravest of the Brave!
The traditions of our ancestors, who came here in the age before, live strong within us.
We know that they were the greatest of warriors who stood against all and were never vanquished, even by the great ancient horror that consumed the stars.
We have kept the old ways and the ancient pact to rebuild and regain the greatness of the champions of old.
The ancient tales speak of powerful enemies, battles greater than any we have seen and incredible dangers.  The honor and glory that awaits us is beyond reckoning!
We will use the star drive our ancestors left for us and send forth the Brave, the Mortalen, to reclaim the stars!

We have found technology that has advanced our understanding of [RESEARCH]Early Warp Field Experiments[/RESEARCH].

We have found technology that has advanced our understanding of [RESEARCH]Research Labs[/RESEARCH].

These ruins provide the following colony bonuses: [BONUS]+3% Colony Development, +9% Construction Research, +7% Scenery[/BONUS]</Text>

Initial communications with the Mortalens have been catastrophically bad. A misunderstanding of their customs caused great offense.</Text>

    <Title>Who are the Ikkuro?</Title>
    <Text>Our analysts have learnt the following about the Ikkuro:

Ikkuro are large, muscular primates with short brown-red fur.

They have very large, widely-spaced ears that enable them to precisely determine the location of sounds. This ability gives them rudimentary sonar skills, allowing them to ‘see’ in the dark.

Ikkuro tend to be intelligent and aggressive, though cautious. Ikkuro are often short-tempered. When provoked or threatened they can quickly become violent. Despite this they are generally gentle and affectionate to those they know well.

They are extremely capable mechanics. Ikkuro can repair nearly any type of machinery. They also confidently reverse-engineer new devices they encounter. In fact they often end up improving the machine when they reassemble it.

This natural mechanical predisposition has also led the Ikkuro to develop the S2F7 RepairBot, an advanced repair robot that can swiftly fix damage to star ships, even while they are in battle.

Ikkuro have a great fascination with trees and plants, and have extensive knowledge of the various types of flora throughout the galaxy. They use this expert understanding to create an array of highly effective herbal medications.

They typically live in tree-dwellings high in the forest canopies on Forest, Continental or Grasslands planets.</Text>

    <Title>Independent Colony of Ikkuros encountered</Title>
    <Text>We have encountered a new independent colony of Ikkuros at [FACTION]Sefokhe 3[/FACTION] in the Sefokhe system.

The Ikkuro are naturally hostile towards us.

We can invade and take over the colony by landing troops. Or we could attempt to colonize them by sending a Colony Ship, although this is unlikely to succeed due to their negative view of us.

Initial communications with the Ikkuros have gone very poorly. We accidentally insulted the Ikkuros, causing great offense.

Research projects are available on our tech tree that can increase our understanding of the Ikkuro. We should research these projects to improve relations with the Ikkuro.</Text>

    <Title>An Underground Colony</Title>
    <Text>Further investigation of the planet revealed an underground colony of the insectoid aliens. These disgusting creatures are most likely descended from survivors of the troop transport crash.

These aliens have proved themselves vile not only in appearance, but also in behavior. They launched a dishonorable assault upon our surface exploration team. The Mortalen explorers were taken by surprise in a cowardly ambush, and though they fought bravely, the were outnumbered and ultimately overcome. We must avenge them and answer blood with blood.</Text>

    <Title>Who are the Boskara?</Title>
    <Text>Our analysts have learnt the following about the Boskara:

Boskara are a ferocious insectoid race with a tough brown exoskeleton skin.

They are the most violent and aggressive race in the known galaxy. They excel in combat, using trickery and deceit to gain the upper-hand. Boskara are untrustworthy allies.

Boskarans instinctive lust for conquest and expansion is without equal. Most other races consider them to be completely without scruples, and thus steer well clear of them. However Boskara have a natural ally in the Sluken, their slightly more reasonable close relatives.

Their technology includes the deadly Shaktur FireStorm, an immensely destructive torpedo weapon. This weapon gives Boskaran star ships very powerful planetary assault capabilities, allowing them to quickly take down defending spaceports at enemy colonies. The Shaktur Firestorm also has a planetary bombardment capability, allowing the Boskara to wipe out the populations of enemy colonies.

Boskara typically inhabit the forbidding terrain of Volcanic planets. Communities may sometimes also be found in the rocky mountains of Carbonaceous planets.</Text>

    <Title>Independent Colony of Boskaras encountered</Title>
    <Text>We have encountered a new independent colony of Boskaras at [FACTION]Brintaal 1[/FACTION] in the Brintaal system.

The Boskara are naturally very hostile towards us.

We can invade and take over the colony by landing troops. Or we could attempt to colonize them by sending a Colony Ship, although this is unlikely to succeed due to their negative view of us.

Initial communications with the Boskaras have been extremely successful. The Boskaras regard us with some friendliness.

The colony has unique features that provide bonuses:
+6% Scenery from Fire Caverns of Brintaal

Research projects are available on our tech tree that can increase our understanding of the Boskara. We should research these projects to improve relations with the Boskara.</Text>

    <Title>Great Chamber of Yaven</Title>
    <Text>We have discovered the [DISCOVERY]Great Chamber of Yaven[/DISCOVERY], ancient ruins from a lost civilization, at the Volcanic moon [LOCATION]Unoasu[/LOCATION] in the Yaven system.

Our orbital inspection reveals that the ruins date from an extremely distant past age.

Should we investigate the ruins?</Text>

    <Title>Refugee Fleet</Title>
    <Text>In the Great Chamber of Yaven we have made a curious discovery:

Our expedition found a powerful locator beacon. They [DISCOVERY]activated the beacon[/DISCOVERY] and its signal has been picked up by a [DISCOVERY]fleet of 11 ships[/DISCOVERY] that has just hyperjumped into the Yaven system!

A message from the fleet explains: 'Greetings! We are Sluken refugees from a far away galaxy. We were driven from our home by a cruel alien race who pursued us in a brutal war. We seek refuge with you and wish to join your empire. In return, we offer you our fleet of ships.'

Their fleet consists of some colony ships and a small escort of military ships. The ships appear to be quite advanced.

If we want to absorb these refugees into our empire and claim their ships then we should move towards their fleet at Unoasu.

These ruins provide the following colony bonuses: [BONUS]+17% Colony Development, +13% Troop Research, +16% Scenery[/BONUS]

We can acquire research bonuses by building a research station here.

We can acquire scenery bonuses by building a resort base here.

To obtain the other bonuses we should colonize this planet.</Text>
